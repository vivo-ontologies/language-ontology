# Imported terms

This folder contains extracts of ontologies whose terms are to be used in the Language 
Ontology.

The full ontologies serving as the source for these extractions can be found in 
[../mirror](../mirror)

Each imported ontology must have a ontology\_terms\_combined.txt file containing
the IRI of the terms to be imported, one IRI per line in the file.
